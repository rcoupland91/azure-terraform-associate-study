# Terraform Associate Study Guide

##
This has been updated and amended to remove the AWS components and change them for Azure components to fit in-line with and the understanding of Terrafrom alongside a provider I use regularly.  This won't change the actual fundamentals of this repo but rather may help more Azure focused people to understand some of the contents.

A collection of hands-on notes, labs, and explanations created while studying for the **HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate** exam.  
This repository focuses on real-world understanding — not just passing the test — by connecting concepts like state, variables, modules, and backends to how they're used in AWS environments.

This repository organizes Terraform Associate certification notes, labs, and checklists into themed learning domains. Each folder contains focused reading material, cheat sheets, and small practice tasks so you can build confidence one topic at a time.

**THE EXAM / INTERVIEW MEMORY HACK**

- For every fundamental, you need a story, an example, and a definition:

- Story: “Here’s when I used it”

- Example: “Here’s a code snippet”

- Definition: “Here’s the clean one-sentence version”

- That’s how you sound senior.

## About This Repo

This repo serves as both a personal learning record and a resource for others preparing for the Terraform Associate certification.  
Each section includes concise explanations, CLI commands, and hands-on lab code that mirrors real-world workflows in Azure.

**Recently Enhanced:** 
- All content updated for Terraform 1.12 and Exam 004 alignment.
