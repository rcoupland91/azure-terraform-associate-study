# Understanding Infrastructure as Code

## What you'll learn
- Differentiate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) from traditional provisioning.
- Explain benefits like repeatability, versioning, and collaboration.
- Recognize Terraform's place among IaC tools and workflows.

## Cheat sheet
- IaC pillars: idempotency, version control, automation.
- Desired state model: declare configuration, let Terraform converge state.
- Use VCS (Git) to manage IaC history and reviews.

## The Terraform File Structure
You need to know the anatomy of a normal project:
```bash
main.tf         # providers + resources
variables.tf    # input variables
outputs.tf      # outputs
terraform.tfvars # values for input variables
```

## Memory Trick: 
- MVO = main, variables, outputs
- Terraform sees all .tf files as one big file
