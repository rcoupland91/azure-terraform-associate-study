## 1. Overview of HCP Terraform/Enterprise

### What is HCP Terraform?

**HCP Terraform** (formerly Terraform Cloud) is HashiCorp's managed service for Terraform workflows:
- Remote state storage
- Remote execution (runs)
- Workspace management
- Projects for organizing workspaces
- Team collaboration
- Policy as Code (Sentinel)
- Private module registry
- VCS integration (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

**HCP Terraform Enterprise** (formerly Terraform Enterprise) is the self-hosted version with the same features, deployed in your infrastructure.

**Note:** HCP Terraform is the new name for Terraform Cloud. The functionality remains the same, but the branding has been updated to align with HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP).

### Key Differences from CLI

| Feature | Terraform CLI | HCP Terraform |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **State Storage** | Local file or S3/GCS backend | Managed remote state |
| **Execution** | Local machine | Remote runners |
| **Workspaces** | Local workspaces | HCP Terraform workspaces (different concept) |
| **Organization** | Manual | Projects for grouping workspaces |
| **Collaboration** | Manual (S3 + locking) | Built-in team features |
| **Policy** | Manual review | Automated Sentinel policies |
| **Modules** | Terraform Registry | Private registry + public |

## 2. HCP Terraform Workspaces

### HCP Terraform Workspaces vs CLI Workspaces

**Important:** These are **different concepts**!

#### CLI Workspaces
```bash
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace select dev
```
- Multiple state files for same configuration
- Used for environment separation
- Local or remote backend

#### HCP Terraform Workspaces
- Separate configuration per workspace
- Independent state files
- Separate variables and settings
- Managed through UI or API
- Organized into Projects

### HCP Terraform Workspace Features

**1. Remote State:**
- Automatic state storage
- Version history
- State locking
- No need to configure S3 backend

**2. Variables:**
- Workspace-specific variables
- Environment variables
- Terraform variables
- Sensitive variable masking

**3. Run Triggers:**
- VCS-driven runs (on commit)
- API-triggered runs
- Scheduled runs

**4. Run Management:**
- Plan and apply in UI
- Run history
- Cost estimation
- Notifications

### Workspace Configuration Example

**HCP Terraform UI:**
1. Create workspace
2. Connect VCS (GitHub/GitLab)
3. Set workspace variables
4. Configure run triggers
5. Assign to a Project (optional)

**Or via API:**
```hcl
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "my-org"
    
    workspaces {
      name = "production"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** In HCP Terraform workspaces, you don't define backend blocks - HCP Terraform handles state automatically.

## 3. Projects

### What are Projects?

**Projects** are an organizational feature in HCP Terraform that allow you to group and manage related workspaces together. Projects provide:

- **Organization**: Group workspaces by team, application, or environment
- **Access Control**: Apply team permissions at the project level
- **Policy Sets**: Assign Sentinel policies to projects
- **Cost Management**: Track costs across project workspaces
- **Visual Organization**: Better workspace management in the UI

### Project Structure

```
Organization: my-company
├── Project: Production
│   ├── Workspace: prod-web
│   ├── Workspace: prod-database
│   └── Workspace: prod-cache
├── Project: Development
│   ├── Workspace: dev-web
│   └── Workspace: dev-database
└── Project: Shared Services
    ├── Workspace: networking
    └── Workspace: security
```

### Creating Projects

**Via UI:**
1. Navigate to Projects in HCP Terraform
2. Click "Create Project"
3. Name the project (e.g., "Production", "Development")
4. Add description (optional)
5. Assign workspaces to the project

**Via API:**
```bash
curl \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  --request POST \
  --data @payload.json \
  https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/organizations/my-org/projects
```

### Project Features

**1. Team Access:**
- Assign teams to projects
- Control workspace access at project level
- Inherit permissions to child workspaces

**2. Policy Sets:**
- Assign Sentinel policy sets to projects
- All workspaces in project inherit policies
- Override at workspace level if needed

**3. Cost Tracking:**
- View cost estimates across project workspaces
- Track spending by project
- Budget alerts per project

**4. Workspace Organization:**
- Filter workspaces by project
- Group related infrastructure
- Better visibility and management

### Example: Project-Based Organization

```hcl
# Workspace configuration for a project
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "my-org"
    
    workspaces {
      tags = ["production", "web"]
      # Workspace will be in "Production" project
    }
  }
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Organize by environment (Production, Staging, Development)
- Group by application or service
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Apply policies at project level when possible

## 4. Remote Execution (Runs)

### How Runs Work

**Run** = A single execution of `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` in HCP Terraform.

**Types of runs:**
1. **VCS-driven:** Triggered by commits to connected repository
2. **API-triggered:** Created via API
3. **UI-triggered:** Manual runs from HCP Terraform UI
4. **CLI-driven:** `terraform plan/apply` queued to HCP Terraform (if configured)

### Run Workflow

```
1. Commit to GitHub
   ↓
2. HCP Terraform detects change
   ↓
3. Creates new run
   ↓
4. Queues plan
   ↓
5. Executes terraform plan remotely
   ↓
6. Shows plan in UI
   ↓
7. Apply (manual or auto)
   ↓
8. Updates state
```

### Run States

- **Pending:** Waiting to start
- **Planning:** Running `terraform plan`
- **Planned:** Plan complete, waiting for apply
- **Applying:** Running `terraform apply`
- **Applied:** Successfully applied
- **Errored:** Failed

### Auto-Apply

**Auto-apply** automatically applies plans that pass:
- Can be enabled per workspace
- Useful for development environments
- Should be disabled for production

---

## 5. Policy as Code with Sentinel

### What is Sentinel?

**Sentinel** is HashiCorp's Policy as Code framework that enforces policies on Terraform runs in HCP Terraform.

**Policy types:**
- **Hard mandatory:** Blocks run if violated
- **Soft mandatory:** Warns but allows override
- **Advisory:** Only warnings

### Common Policy Examples

#### Policy 1: Restrict VM Sizes

```python
import "tfplan"

allowed_sizes = ["Standard_B1s", "Standard_B2s", "Standard_D2s_v3"]

main = rule {
  all tfplan.resource_changes as _, rc {
    rc.type is not "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" or
    rc.change.after.size in allowed_sizes
  }
}

```

**What it does:** Only allows specific VM Sizes.

#### Policy 2: Require Tags

```python
import "tfplan"

required_tags = ["Environment", "Owner", "CostCenter"]

main = rule {
  all tfplan.resource_changes as _, rc {
    rc.change.after.tags is undefined or
    all required_tags as tag {
      tag in rc.change.after.tags
    }
  }
}

```

**What it does:** Ensures all resources have required tags.

#### Policy 3: Block Public Storage Accounts

```python
import "tfplan"

main = rule {
  all tfplan.resource_changes as _, rc {
    rc.type is not "azurerm_storage_account" or
    rc.change.after.allow_blob_public_access is false
  }
}

```

**What it does:** Prevents creation of publicly accessible Storage Accounts.

### When Policies Run

Policies are evaluated:
- **After plan, before apply**
- Can pass, warn, or fail the run
- Failed policies block apply (if hard mandatory)

### Policy Sets

**Policy sets** group policies and assign them to:
- Organizations (all workspaces)
- Projects (all workspaces in project)
- Workspaces (specific workspaces)

## 6. Private Module Registry

### What is the Private Module Registry?

Allows organizations to:
- Publish modules internally
- Version modules
- Share modules across teams
- Control access

### Publishing Modules

**Via UI:**
1. Connect VCS repository
2. HCP Terraform detects modules
3. Auto-publishes on tags/releases

**Module structure:**
```
terraform-azure-vpc/
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
└── README.md
```

**Versioning:**
- Tag in Git: `v1.0.0`
- HCP Terraform creates module version

### Using Private Modules

```hcl
module "vnet" {
  source = "app.terraform.io/my-org/azurerm-vnet/azure"
  version = "1.0.0"
  
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

**Source format:**
```
<HOSTNAME>/<ORGANIZATION>/<MODULE-NAME>/<PROVIDER>
```
